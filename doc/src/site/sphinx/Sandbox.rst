=============================================

TODO


F.A.Q about the sandbox
=======================

##### **I am in the same directory that I copy the Vagrant file but I have this error:**::


    A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this
    command. Run vagrant init to create a new Vagrant environment. Or,
    get an ID of a target machine from vagrant global-status to run
    this command on. A final option is to change to a directory with a
    Vagrantfile and to try again.


Make sure your file name is Vagrantfile instead of Vagrantfile.txt or VagrantFile.

##### **When I execute vagrant ssh I have this error:** ::


    ssh executable not found in any directories in the %PATH% variable. Is an
    SSH client installed? Try installing Cygwin, MinGW or Git, all of which
    contain an SSH client. Or use your favorite SSH client with the following
    authentication information shown below:


We need to install `Cygwin <https://cygwin.com/install.html>`_ or `Git for Windows <http://git-scm.com/download/win>`_.
